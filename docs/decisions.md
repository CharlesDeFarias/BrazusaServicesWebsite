# Architectural Decisions

This file tracks locked decisions about architecture, UX behavior, and project structure.
Git-ignored and local only. Read this at session start alongside `lib/clients/` and `app/api/`.

When a decision is made, add it here before the session ends. Format:
**Decision:** what was decided
**Why:** the reasoning
**Constraints:** what this rules out going forward

## UI Architecture

**Decision:** `ClientAccordion` and `Services` are separate full-width sections, in that order (accordion first, services second).
**Why:** Users should select their client type first, which then influences what they see in Services. Side-by-side layout was broken at all screen sizes.
**Constraints:** Never put them back in a shared horizontal container. Never reverse the order without discussion.

**Decision:** State sync between ClientAccordion and Services is one-way. Accordion selection sets the Services filter. Services filter can be changed independently without affecting the accordion.
**Why:** Users may want to explore services for a different type than their space without losing their place in the accordion.
**Constraints:** Accordion does not react to Services filter changes. This is a deliberate asymmetry.

**Decision:** "We clean it all" card in ClientAccordion sits at the bottom of the list and opens an inline expansion (not a modal). The expansion contains 3 navigation links: Testimonials, Pricing, QuoteDrawer.
**Why:** Bottom position matches visual weight (fallback option, not primary). Inline expansion keeps user in context and works on mobile.
**Constraints:** Do not re-add the `onCTAClick('other')` drawer behavior to this card.

## CSS / Design System

**Decision:** CSS opacity tokens use numeric naming: `--color-[base]-[integer]` (e.g. `--color-white-10`, `--color-navy-30`).
**Why:** Self-documenting for a developer not strong in CSS. No need to memorize what "faint" or "muted" means.
**Constraints:** New tokens follow this pattern. The existing semantic aliases (`--color-white-faint` etc.) are kept as-is since they're already in use.

**Decision:** Gold tint tokens: `--color-gold-5`, `--color-gold-10`, `--color-gold-25`, `--color-gold-60`, `--color-gold-90`. Usage described in globals.css comments.
**Why:** `rgba(196,154,68,N)` appeared in 5 files with ~10 different values — no tokens existed to reach for.
**Constraints:** Use these instead of raw gold rgba values. If a value doesn't fit a stop, use the nearest and note it.

**Decision:** Error tokens: `--color-error`, `--color-error-bg`, `--color-error-border`.
**Why:** `#E07070` appeared hardcoded in 2 files. Form validation states need a consistent set.

**Decision:** Seven sections that had flat solid backgrounds (About, QuickContact, ServiceArea, Positioning, HowItWorks, Testimonials, Pricing) get one of two layering treatments:
- Treatment A (light sections): subtle linen-to-off-white gradient + geometric grid at ~1.5% opacity
- Treatment B (ServiceArea): `.grain` class + faint gold radial glow
**Why:** Sections looked like a plain word document. FinalCTA's grid + radial pattern is the reference for "done."

## Pricing Section

**Decision:** No static price ranges displayed anywhere in the Pricing section.
**Why:** Static ranges create anchoring pressure and don't reflect Brazusa's custom/flexible pricing model.
**Constraints:** Pricing section focuses on how pricing is calculated. Actual examples live in Testimonials as case studies.

**Decision:** Pricing section links to Testimonials via 5 client-type filter chips (STR / Property / Offices / Apartments / Other). In-page scroll for now; hash links deferred.

---

## Form (QuoteDrawer)

**Decision:** Contact is split into separate `email` and `phone` fields (both optional, at least one required). Preference toggle is shown when phone is filled, auto-derived when only email.
**Why:** Single contact field was ambiguous. Users should be able to provide both.
**Constraints:** This change touches the API route, Airtable fields, and Resend template. Never implement without producing a change manifest and getting confirmation first.
